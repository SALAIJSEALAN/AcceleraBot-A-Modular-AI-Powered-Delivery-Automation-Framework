# AcceleraBot-A-Modular-AI-Powered-Delivery-Automation-Framework
AcceleraBot is a plug-and-play low-code platform powered by modular intelligent agents


This is a hackathon-ready, fully functional prototype simulating a reusable AI-powered delivery accelerator. It demonstrates how enterprises can automate incident triage, onboarding/KYC, and reporting workflows without requiring real APIs or production-grade integrations.

The prototype is organized into three main modules with a sidebar for data selection and controls:

1️⃣ Sidebar Features

Project Name Input: Users can specify a project, e.g., "BFSI Modernization".

Data Selection:

Checkbox for using a pre-generated sample dataset.

Option to upload a custom CSV for real-world testing.

Run Button: Executes data enrichment and agent simulation.

2️⃣ Module Tabs
a) Incident Triage Agent

Classifies each issue or task automatically using rule-based keyword detection into categories:

Bug, Feature, Improvement, Security, Data, DevOps, UX, General.

Suggests priority levels (High, Medium, Low) based on:

Urgency of the task (days to due date)

Keywords indicating criticality (payment, production, blocked)

Current task status

Displays a data table showing task title, description, type, and priority.

Purpose: Demonstrates how AI can reduce manual effort in categorizing and prioritizing enterprise incidents.

b) Onboarding / KYC Agent

Simulates document/data extraction from onboarding or KYC tasks.

For demo purposes, it reuses the incident dataset to show extraction, classification, and priority suggestion.

Purpose: Illustrates how reusable AI agents can accelerate onboarding workflows without requiring technical setup.

c) Reporting Agent

Generates visual insights and KPIs:

Total tasks, Completed, Open, Overdue, High Priority

Status distribution bar chart

Allows downloads of enriched data and reports:

CSV export of enriched dataset

Workflow YAML template for reusable agent pipelines

Jira JSON template for task creation

PDF report including KPIs and status chart

Purpose: Demonstrates how AI can automate reporting and create enterprise-ready outputs.

3️⃣ Backend Logic

Task Classification: classify_task() uses regex rules to assign categories.

Priority Suggestion: suggest_priority() calculates task severity based on text, due dates, and status.

Data Enrichment: enrich() computes:

Normalized status

Days to due

Overdue flag

Type (category)

Priority

Mock Data Generation: generate_sample_data() creates 50 sample tasks for demonstration.

PDF & CSV Export: Users can download reports with charts, KPIs, workflow templates, and Jira task templates.

4️⃣ Innovation & Hackathon Value

Reusable AI Agent Templates: Shows modular approach to triage, onboarding, and reporting.

Interactive & Visual: KPI cards, tables, and charts create a professional, enterprise dashboard feel.

No API Needed: Fully functional simulation using rule-based AI, making it free and easy to demo.

Downloadable Artifacts: CSV, YAML, JSON, and PDF demonstrate reusable outputs for enterprises.

Quick Setup: Single-file prototype, works with Python + Streamlit + common packages.

5️⃣ Overall

This prototype simulates an intelligent delivery accelerator that:

Reduces manual triage and reporting effort

Enables fast onboarding workflow simulation

Generates enterprise-ready, reusable reports and templates

Demonstrates a modular, low-code approach suitable for BFSI, Healthcare, or Manufacturing
